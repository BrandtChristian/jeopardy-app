# Jeopardy Game Development Log

## Project Overview
Building a web-based Jeopardy game system with host and player views, featuring real-time synchronization and simple security. The game will be hosted at jeopardy.brandt-thomassen.dk.

## Technical Stack
- Frontend: Next.js (React) with shadcn/ui components
- Backend: Node.js with Socket.IO (to be implemented)
- Hosting: Vercel (frontend) and Render.com (backend)
- Domain: jeopardy.brandt-thomassen.dk

## Development Progress

### Phase 1: Basic Setup (In Progress)

#### March 2024
1. Created new Next.js project in `/react` directory:
   - App Router enabled
   - TypeScript support
   - Tailwind CSS integration
   - src/ directory structure

2. Initialized shadcn/ui with components:
   - Style: New York
   - Base color: Zinc
   - Core components added:
     - Button (for buzzers and navigation)
     - Card (for question tiles)
     - Dialog (for answers and game controls)

## Current Phase Progress
We are in Phase 1 (Basic Setup) of the development plan:
- [x] Create React project
- [ ] Set up Vercel deployment
- [ ] Configure domain (jeopardy.brandt-thomassen.dk)
